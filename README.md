This is an implementation of multiple reinforcement learning models. These algorithms were implemented using pytorch, gymnasium environments, and neural networks. 

The following models have successfully trained to adequate reward in a number of environments:

TD3 algorithm model
Rainbow DQN algorithm model
SAC algorithm (Continuous Action Spaces)
